# Target Ledger

Each numeric figure/table/panel target gets one entry.

| Target ID | Paper item | Type | Formula dependencies | Formula gate | Status | Data output | Figure output | Check output | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Status Values

- `not_started`
- `spec_ready`
- `running`
- `reproduced`
- `physically_consistent`
- `algorithmically_consistent`
- `partial`
- `blocked`
- `planned_large_scale`
- `failed`

For `blocked` or `planned_large_scale` targets, add a plan document and config
path in the `Notes` column, for example:

```text

config/<target>_recommended.yaml
```
